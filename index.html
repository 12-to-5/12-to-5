    <h1>How to sign up</h1>

    <p>
      Click the sign up button on the top of the page. Fill out the google form and we will try to fit it into our schedule. Before you sign up for a job, sign up for a 30 minute consultation in the form so that we can tell you how long it will take and pricing. After we tell you that, sign up for a time that will work for you and we will try to fit it into our schedule.
